# scraper_App

on the index file I have the functionality that uses puppeteer to collect data from two tables. The collected data gets placed into an excel spreadsheet

on the search file I have similar functionlaity. Selenium is used to navigate to a page and interacts with a map. Using grid coordinates, the program clicks on the coordinates which correspond to points on the map. After each click, information for the map region that is clicked on is rendered on the page and collected. All of the collected information is saved and also written to an excel spreadsheet
